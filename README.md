# Testing with Way-Points (TWP)

TODO's:
* add scenarios in this repo
* specify link to dockerhup image for ready to use prototype (with setup instructions for the required language service, which has its own docker image)
* provide script to download experiment results and apks
* add jupyter notebook (from google colab) to compute our diagrams
